    <h2>Home Screen:</h2> • This is the page that will first show up when you open the app. From here the user can navigate to any of the four pages at the bottom of this window. This area at the bottom of window is called the tab area. Above this area is where the timetable
    will be displayed once you are logged in. Above the text “Please Log In” is the area where you can select which day you would like displayed.
    <h2>Homework:</h2> • The homework tab can display user input homework. The homework tab can be accessed by pressing on the ‘Homework’ button in the tab area. Homework can be added by pressing the ‘Add’ button in the top right, and all added homework can be removed
    at once by pressing the ‘Remove All’ button.
    <h2>Adding, Editing and Deleting Homework:</h2> • After pressing the ‘Add’ button on the homework screen, another screen will open, asking the user to input: Subject, Description and Due Date. The due date will default to today’s date. Pressing save will then save the homework to the device, making
    it available again after the apps close.
    <br/>• Tapping on an existing homework entry will allow the user to either edit or delete specific entry’s. When editing a homework entry, the fields will default to what the user had originally entered. Pressing save will update the user’s homework
    entry, and cancel will leave the homework unchanged.
    <h2>Logging In and Out:</h2> • To log in and out, the user must use the timetable tab in the tab area. To log in, if you are logged out, tap the ‘Log In’ button in the top right to bring up the login window, where the user will input their student number and password. Once the
    user has submitted this by pressing log in, this window will disappear and a new one will appear, asking the user to wait until the timetable has been retrieved. Note: this can take up to a minute to work. Upon success, an alert will let you know
    that your timetable has been downloaded, otherwise you will be alerted that something went wrong.
    <br/>• Once this alert is displayed, you may now click on a day and week where the days are displayed. This will bring up your school timetable for that day.
    <br/>• To log out, press the log out button in the top right.
